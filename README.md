## ðŸ”Ž Idea and Novelty
- Reconstruct images, which participants viewed during the simultaneous fMRI-EEG procedure
- There is no method that uses a simultaneous fMRI-EEG signal (only fMRI / EEG separately)

## ðŸ’¡ Abstract
The study investigates the task of reconstructing visual stimuli from simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. A novel method for reconstructing visual stimuli using diffusion neural networks has been proposed. A technique for encoding simultaneous fMRI and EEG data has been developed, and supervised learning has been applied to train the encoding architecture. Experiments were conducted on a state-of-the-art dataset with a large number of participants.
