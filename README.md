## Tips
- The `index.html` file contains comments instructing you what to replace, you should follow these comments.
- The `meta` tags in the `index.html` file are used to provide metadata about your paper 
(e.g. helping search engine index the website, showing a preview image when sharing the website, etc.)
- The resolution of images and videos can usually be around 1920-2048, there rarely a need for better resolution that take longer to load. 
- All the images and videos you use should be compressed to allow for fast loading of the website (and thus better indexing by search engines). For images, you can use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com), for videos you can need to find the tradeoff between size and quality.
- When using large video files (larger than 10MB), it's better to use youtube for hosting the video as serving the video from the website can take time.
- Replace the favicon to one of your choosing (the default one is of the Hebrew University).
